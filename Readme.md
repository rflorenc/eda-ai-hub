# EDA AI Hub

EDA AI Hub is a playground for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects (AI), using a common code base for multiple jupyter notebooks.  
Refer to the available jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) for project details.  

## Requirements  

We need to install all the required python modules.  
This can be done by executing `make requirements` in the base project folder.    
For example:

```bash 
cd $HOME/workspace/eda-hub  
make requirements
```
