# EDA Hub

EDA Hub is a playground for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), using a common code base for multiple jupyter notebooks.    

## Requirements
We need to install all the required python modules.  
This can be done by executing `make requirements` in the base project folder.    
For example:

```bash 
cd $HOME/workspace/eda-hub  
make requirements
```
